# WebAppTesting-Selenium

>In this project we explore the functionality of the Selenium Webdriver for Firefox and Chrome browsers. In particular:
>- We learn to perform basic operations with the webdriver.
>- We study how to create various locators, such as Xpath, CSS, link_text, class, etc.
>- We learn how to interact with different web elements, including check_boxes, buttons, hyperlinks, tabs, and static_drop_downs.
>
>Ultimately, we apply the acquired skills to scrape data tables from 2020 Summer Paralympics website.

### Description

- Check out the 'Browsing_operations.py' file in order to try out basic commands: maximaze or minimize the browser window, go back and forward buttons, access the page title and url, or reload and close the browser window.
- The 'Locators' folder contains files that provide details on how to construct relative and absolute Xpaths, CSS locators using the title, id, or class attributes, as well as how to find elemements by their id, name, class, link_text, or partial_link_text.  
- The 'Webelements' folder contains a Python script that explores the functionality of the selenium webdriver through its interaction with various elements of a webpage. This script also includes a piece of code that can be employed in order to organize a proper interaction of the driver with iFrames.
- The 'DataExtraction' folder contains a Jupyter notebook that applies Selenium Webdriver and common Python libriries to extract results of 2021 Paralympic Games in Tokyo from the official website of the games.

### Dataset online
