# WebAppTesting-Selenium

>In this project we explore the functionality of the Selenium Webdriver for Firefox and Chrome browsers. In particular:
>- We learn to perform basic operations with the webdriver
>- We study how to create various locators, such as Xpath, CSS, Link text, Class element, etc.
>- We learn how to interact with different web elements, including Check Boxes, Buttons, Hyperlinks, Tabs, and Static drop downs.
>
>Ultimately, we apply the acquired skills to scrape data tables from 2020 Summer Paralympics website.
